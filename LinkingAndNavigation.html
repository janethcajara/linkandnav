					<h2 id="SourceAnchors">Source Anchors</h2>
					<p>An anchor source is an HTML element that creates
					 a link to another web page, a specific section within
					 a page, or even an external source like a document or email1.
					 The source is the text, image, or button that links to another 
					 resource, while the destination is the resource that the source
					 anchor links to2. Anchor text refers to words or phrases that you 
					 can click on to access other web resources3. Anchor text links often
					 direct users to other pages on your website, but they can also link to 
					 external sources3.</p>
					<h2 id="URL">URLs</h2>
   					<p>A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although 
					 many people use the two terms interchangeably. URLs occur most commonly to 
					 reference web pages ( http ), but are also used for file transfer ( ftp ), 
					email ( mailto ), database access ( JDBC ), and many other applications.</p>	
					<h2 id="DestinationAnchors">Destination Anchors</h2>
					<p>The Anchor element in HTML Anchors An anchor is a piece of text which marks
					 the beginning and/or the end of a hypertext link. The text between the opening
					 tag and the closing tag is either the start or destination (or both) of a link.</p>
					<h2 id="Example">Examples</h2>
					<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using 
					a markup language. HTML is an abbreviation of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext 
					defines the link between the web pages.</p>
